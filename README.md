# Software Setup <a name="software-setup"></a>

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE) <a name="ide"></a>

An integrated development environment (or IDE) is the application you use to write your code (i.e. a "source code editor"), and it's often bundled with debugging tools, a version control GUI, clickable class hierarchies, build tools, and so on. We'll be using VSCode, which is a popular IDE used in both research and industry. (PyCharm is another great option, particularly to debug Python â€” but we'll stick with VSCode.)

### Installing VSCode

Visit Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com) to download the stable build of VSCode for your operating system.

## Version Control <a name="version-control"></a>

### Setting up Git on your local machine via SSH

### Cloning your project repository

## Dependency Management and Virtual Environment <a name="dependency-venv"></a>

### Creating a virtual environment with conda

### Creating a `requirements.txt` file and freezing dependencies

### Adding, commiting, and pushing changes with Git

## Installing PyTorch <a name="installing-pytorch"></a>

PyTorch can be installed very easily using conda. Visit [PyTorch's website](https://pytorch.org) and select the configuration based on your machine. This will be `Stable` for your build, `Conda` for your package, `Python` for your language, and `CPU` for your compute platform. (Later on, when we run model training on GPU with CUDA, we'll install the appropriate CUDA versions, but don't worry about that for now!)

Make sure your virtual environment is active in your terminal instance, and then run the `conda install ...` command that the PyTorch site has generated for you based on your configuration.
