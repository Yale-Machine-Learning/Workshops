# Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This page contains links to resources which will introduce you to machine learning and deep learning. We encourage you to go through them in order, at your own pace, and to post any questions you may have on Slack.

This page also contains links to video walkthroughs corresponding to several of our introductory workshops, in case you missed them in-person or wanted a quick refresher.
